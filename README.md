# TicTacToe

As I was learning Android App development with Rob Percival's Udemy course, I decided I'd take my own route when making a Tic Tac Toe game. Instead of using arrays (which is something I should have thought of) I hardcoded imageviews with their own keys, and ended up with a fun and working Tic Tac Toe game. 

The game has a reset button, and medievel themed X and O images, and has the classic TicTacToe fun appeal. It was my first solo project with Android Studio and  still challenge my friends to a quick game to this day.
